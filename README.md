# hw06-weather-dashboard

Homework 6 for my bootcamp class

Had to go over the alloted time due to unforseen family circumstances that required a lot of attention and time during the week, other than going over time I was really happy with the end result due to it working extremely well. I think the only thing that probably could've been updated is maybe a try/catch to handle cities that don't exist in the api or cities that are mispelled, but since we haven't covered that much in class I wasn't really sure how to implement so I just didn't do it since it wasn't in the requirements. At the start of the hw I had like everything in one class, but when I finally got more of the code alloted to different classes everything became a lot easier to visualize. The homework assignment was a weather dashboard this week where we had to use multiple APIs to collect different weather data and display it nicely to the screen. The website had to save the most recent city to local storage, get a 5 day forecast, have search history of cities previously searched, and display some data from the current day.

The point I struggled with most for the project was initially having too much in the same function as well as some of the html/css stuff due to front end still being a little foreign to me. Unsure if I used conventional means but am happy with my results this hw assignment.

One thing I am very proud of is how I was able to do the part of the assignment where I create the 5 day schedule without having to use static elements on the page, and by that I had used less lines in my HTML section.
